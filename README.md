# Touch Table Navigator

Hi, this Victor. Thanks for letting me tackle this challange. I initially started this project on codesandbox but of its auto refresh but had some difficulties importing the code back into my VS Code. That prompted me to redo parts of code again causing me to loose a lot of time i could have used to work more on it.

I do not believe i meet all the usecases required for this project. I had some questions or rather confusion on some of the screens, some elements were almost impossible to implement, like the background image because the image was not provided and other things. 

However, I was able to implement the design and some of it's functionalities with some tests as close as i could. All my major steps were all documented on my commits as requested. I am also happy to discuss what i could have done better or other things i wanted to do that i could not because of time.
